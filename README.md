# Clock
A clock in C++

This is a clock that displays the time in a 12H and 24H format.
I made sure to account for any adjustments a user will make, by never allowing the clock's value to go above 12 for hours, or 60 for minutes and seconds.
This clock could be better by having a graphical display. I could enhance the whole experience with better graphical user interface.
The most challenging part of writing the code was converting the datetime object into an integer to be able to add to and subtract from it.
StackOverflow came in handy for this, as there were senior developers with easy-to-understand guides for this task posted already.
This program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable because of its simplicity. This was the first C++ project.
